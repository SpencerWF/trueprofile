*This was a project to take the state of a streamer from Twitch.tv and use it to update the Twitter profile of that streamer.*

To update a twitter profile picture requried the twitter api path 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/update_profile_image.json'.  Which has been deprecated as of May 2023.

As such this is now just an example project I will refer back to sometimes when needed, all secrets have been removed.

# trueprofile
Service to update Social Media profiles to reflect live information.

Connects to the repository 'trueprofile_frontend'.
